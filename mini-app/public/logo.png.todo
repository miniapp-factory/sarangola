A colorful Filipino kite (sarangola) with bright geometric patterns and a bamboo frame, rendered in a cheerful cartoon style. The kite is diamond-shaped, with a vibrant mix of native textile colors (red, yellow, blue, green). A long fluttering tail ribbon curves naturally in the wind, adding motion. The background is transparent, and the image is high resolution, ready for use as a game sprite and app logo.
