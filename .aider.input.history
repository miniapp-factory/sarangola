+Code the following app
+```
+Create a simple side-scrolling mini-game inspired by Flappy Bird, but redesigned with a Filipino cultural theme. The player controls a **sarangola**, a traditional Philippine kite decorated with bright local patterns and fluttering tail ribbons that move naturally as it flies. Instead of pipes, the obstacles should be **coconut trees (niyog)** arranged in pairs, with varying gaps and heights that the player must navigate through. The environment should feature a bright blue sky with soft clouds and a rural Philippine backdrop, including fields, nipa huts, and distant mountains, along with a simple grassy or earthy ground. Gameplay should remain straightforward: tapping, clicking, or pressing causes the sarangola to rise, while releasing allows gravity to pull it downward. The game ends if the kite hits a coconut tree or the ground, and the score increases by one for every successfully passed obstacle pair. The art style should be colorful, cheerful, and cartoon-like, with smooth animations for the kite and its tail. Light, breezy music should play in the background, accompanied by subtle wind or “flap” sounds when the kite rises, and soft chimes for scoring. Overall, the mechanics should stay simple, responsive, fast-paced, and addictive, similar to the original Flappy Bird.
