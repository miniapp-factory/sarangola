+Code the following app
+```
+Create a simple side-scrolling mini-game inspired by Flappy Bird, but redesigned with a Filipino cultural theme. The player controls a **sarangola**, a traditional Philippine kite decorated with bright local patterns and fluttering tail ribbons that move naturally as it flies. Instead of pipes, the obstacles should be **coconut trees (niyog)** arranged in pairs, with varying gaps and heights that the player must navigate through. The environment should feature a bright blue sky with soft clouds and a rural Philippine backdrop, including fields, nipa huts, and distant mountains, along with a simple grassy or earthy ground. Gameplay should remain straightforward: tapping, clicking, or pressing causes the sarangola to rise, while releasing allows gravity to pull it downward. The game ends if the kite hits a coconut tree or the ground, and the score increases by one for every successfully passed obstacle pair. The art style should be colorful, cheerful, and cartoon-like, with smooth animations for the kite and its tail. Light, breezy music should play in the background, accompanied by subtle wind or “flap” sounds when the kite rises, and soft chimes for scoring. Overall, the mechanics should stay simple, responsive, fast-paced, and addictive, similar to the original Flappy Bird.

+Create a simple 2D side-scrolling mini-game inspired by *Flappy Bird*, but redesigned with a strong **Filipino cultural theme**. The player controls a **sarangola**, a traditional Philippine kite decorated with bright local patterns and a fluttering tail that moves naturally while flying. Tapping, clicking, or pressing a key makes the sarangola rise; releasing lets gravity pull it downward.
+
+Replace Flappy Bird’s pipes with **pairs of coconut trees (niyog)** that have randomized heights and gaps. The player must guide the kite through these gaps without hitting the trees or the ground. The game should include a **scoring system** where the score increases by **+1 for every obstacle pair passed**.
+
+The background should depict a cheerful rural Philippine setting: bright blue sky, soft clouds, rice fields, nipa huts, coconut trees, and distant mountains. Use a colorful, cartoon-like art style with smooth animations for the kite and its tail.
+
+Include a **landing page** before the game starts, containing two large friendly buttons: **“Play”** and **“New Game”**.
+
+* **Play** starts the game immediately.
+* **New Game** resets the score and restarts the game.
+
+Audio should include light breezy music, gentle wind “flap” sounds when the kite rises, and soft chime effects when scoring. Gameplay should feel responsive, simple, fast-paced, and addictive — similar to the original Flappy Bird, but with a distinctly Filipino cultural vibe.
